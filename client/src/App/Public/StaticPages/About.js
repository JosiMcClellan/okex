    <Typography variant="headline">The Problem</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2">Human are complex; we need many kinds of interaction, and while matchmaking sites are powerful, they&#39;re really only used for the romantic stuff.  That&#39;s both a symptom and a cause of our tendency to put our whole lives into just one relationship with one person, sometimes to an unhealthy degree.  It&#39;s not good for your controller methods, and it&#39;s not good for you.</Typography>

    <Typography variant="headline">Our Solution</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2">Activism, support, collaboration, and other categories could benefit from that same tool.  We want to be the Stack Exchange Network to OkCupid&#39;s Stack Overflow (not that we&#39;ll be affiliated or even jock their steez). By letting self-moderating communities generate their own match criteria and design, we can build an internet-scale network with minimal content administration.</Typography>

    <Typography variant="headline">The Caveat</Typography>
    <Typography variant="body2">This was a two-week, one-person, self-directed school project.  I worked with several technologies I wasn&#39;t familiar with, and as such didn&#39;t get as many features built as I would have liked (those end-to-end tests, though!). For now, this is Just Another Forum&trade;, but I&#39;ll keep working on it until it&#39;s what I described above.</Typography>

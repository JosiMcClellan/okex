# OKX <small>___SE meets OkC... a perfect match!___
</small> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JosiMcClellan/okex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JosiMcClellan/okex)
## TL;DR
This is where I'll put a one-liner about the purpose and a code block of unexplained setup commands.

## Overview
#### The Problem
It's time to refactor our relationships.  Human are complex; we need many kinds of interaction, and while matchmaking sites are powerful, they're really only used for the romantic stuff.  That's both a symptom and a cause of our tendency to put our whole lives into just one relationship, one person, sometimes to an unhealthy degree.  It's not good for your controller methods, and it's not good for you.

#### The Solution
Activism, support, collaboration, discussion, and many other categories could benefit from that same tool.  We want to be the Stack Exchange Network to OkCupid's Stack Overflow (not that we'll be affiliated or even jock their steez). By letting self-moderating communities generate their own match criteria and design, we can build an internet-scale network with minimal content administration.  I deleted my XML joke, you're welcome.

#### The Technology
__React Client__: (React Router, Material UI)
__Rails JSON API__: (Redis, ActiveJob, ActionCable)
__3rd-party APIs__ (SendGrid, Google OAuth, Google Maps)
__Feature Tests:__: Cypress
__PaaS:__ Heroku
__CI__: Travis

#### The School Assignment

## Setup
...there's really not much to set up yet.
